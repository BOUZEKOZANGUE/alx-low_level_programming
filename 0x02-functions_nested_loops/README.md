0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
isalpha() takes in an argument and converts it to ASCII. If the ASCII value is between 65 and 90 or between 97 and 122, it returns a non-zero value. If the ASCII​ value is out of these two ranges, zero is ​returned.

An alternative approach (without using islower()) to check whether a character is a lowercase letter or not, is to check if the character lies between 97 and 122 inclusive. If the character lies between 97 and 122 inclusive, it is a lowercase letter.
